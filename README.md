# MeetNote

MeetNote is a desktop application that helps administrators turn recorded
meetings into reviewable and trackable action items.

It provides a Kivy-based interface for uploading meeting recordings,
transcribing them, generating candidate action items, reviewing them, and
managing approved items on a task board.

## Features

- Desktop user interface built with Kivy.
- Local transcription of meeting recordings using faster-whisper.
- AI-assisted extraction of candidate action items using Google Gemini.
- Administrative review workflow for action items.
- Status transitions for proposed, approved, rejected, and completed items.
- Task board for managing verified action items.
- Poetry-based dependency management.
- Automated tests, coverage reporting, and static analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13
- Poetry
- A Google Gemini API key
- Optional: ffmpeg, if required by your local audio/video setup

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se-2526-MEETNOTE/Artifact.git](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se-2526-MEETNOTE/Artifact.git)
cd Artifact
```

Install the base dependencies:

```bash
py -3.12 -m poetry install
```

To include local transcription support, install the optional `whisper`
dependency group:

```bash
py -3.12 -m poetry install --extras whisper
```

## Configuration

MeetNote requires a Google Gemini API key to generate action items from
meeting transcripts.

Create a `.env` file in the repository root:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
```

Do not commit `.env`, API keys, or other secrets to the repository.

## Running the application

Start MeetNote with:

```bash
py -3.12 -m poetry run python -m meetnote
```

## Development commands

Run the test suite:

```bash
py -3.12 -m poetry run poe test
```

Run static checks:

```bash
py -3.12 -m poetry run poe static-checks
```

Run Ruff checks:

```bash
py -3.12 -m poetry run poe ruff-check
```

Automatically fix straightforward Ruff issues:

```bash
py -3.12 -m poetry run poe ruff-fix
```

Format the code:

```bash
py -3.12 -m poetry run poe format
```

Run type checking:

```bash
py -3.12 -m poetry run poe mypy
```

Measure test coverage:

```bash
py -3.12 -m poetry run poe coverage
py -3.12 -m poetry run poe coverage-report
```

Generate an HTML coverage report:

```bash
py -3.12 -m poetry run poe coverage-html
```

2. Transcribe the recording locally using faster-whisper.
3. Extract candidate action items using Google Gemini.
4. Review each candidate action item.
5. Approve, edit, reject, or request changes.
6. Manage approved items on the task board.
